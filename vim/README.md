## vim initial configuration

## This is my initial vimrc file, to change this to git bare

### Vundle path:
```
	~/.vim/bundle/
```

### Customizations
- [x] Install vundle
- [x] vim-tmux-navigator
- [x] Disable automatic comment insertion
- [x] Added coc.vim support
	- [x] nodejs was added as a requirement
- [] Coc.vim
	- [] .vimrc configuration
	- [] bash script to install it ( vim -c )
	- [] extensions (I'm using a shell script)
		- [] coc-pyright
		- [] coc-snippets

 
### TODO
- 
- [] Use git bare for .dot files
- [] Write a script to isntall vundle and all the plugins instead of having it as .vimrc code
	- [] shell script: e.g. vim -c 'CocInstall coc-pyright coc-snippets|q'
